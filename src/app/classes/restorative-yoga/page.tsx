  { question: 'Is restorative yoga suitable for beginners?', answer: 'Absolutely. Restorative yoga is one of the most accessible forms of yoga. No previous experience is needed — the practice is about rest and release, not flexibility or strength.' },
  { question: 'How is restorative yoga different from Yin Yoga?', answer: 'While both are slow practices, restorative yoga focuses on complete passive relaxation using full prop support, whereas Yin Yoga applies gentle stress to connective tissues. Many students enjoy both as complementary practices.' },
  { question: 'What should I wear to a restorative yoga class?', answer: 'Comfortable, warm clothing is recommended. The body tends to cool down during restorative practice, so layers are helpful. Socks and a blanket can add extra warmth.' },

              Restorative Yoga is a gentle and deeply calming practice designed to support relaxation and nervous system recovery. In contrast to more active styles of yoga, restorative sessions encourage stillness, allowing the body and mind to slow down and release accumulated tension. Here in the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by the natural calm of the landscape, restorative practice feels particularly nourishing.

              During a class at Present Heart Living near Inverness, supportive props such as bolsters, blankets and cushions are used to help the body rest comfortably in a series of relaxed postures. These positions are held for longer periods, allowing the muscles to soften and the breath to become slow and steady.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The intention of restorative yoga is to create a space where the body can rest fully without effort. This encourages the nervous system to shift away from the constant stimulation of daily life and enter a state of deep relaxation. Sessions may also incorporate elements such as breath awareness, gentle <Link href="/classes/sound-baths" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">sound</Link> or guided relaxation to further enhance calm.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For many people, restorative yoga provides an important opportunity to pause and reset. The practice can be particularly supportive for individuals experiencing stress, fatigue, burnout or difficulty switching off from the demands of work and daily life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              A typical class includes four to six supported postures, each held for five to fifteen minutes. Between postures, you are guided through gentle transitions. The overall experience is one of deep, nurturing rest — a rare gift in our busy modern lives.

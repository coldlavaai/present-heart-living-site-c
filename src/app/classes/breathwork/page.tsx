              Breathwork practices explore the relationship between breathing and overall wellbeing. Although breathing is something we do automatically, learning to work with the breath consciously can have a powerful effect on both the body and mind. In the clean Highland air near Inverness, breathwork takes on a special quality — the natural environment supporting deeper connection with each breath.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Sessions may include gentle breathing exercises, periods of stillness and time for reflection. Techniques range from calming patterns that settle the nervous system to more energising practices that build vitality and focus.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Breathwork is often integrated into yoga and meditation traditions as a way to support awareness and concentration. By paying attention to the rhythm of the breath, students learn how breathing influences energy levels, emotional responses and physical tension.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              Students are encouraged to approach the practice with curiosity and patience, allowing breathing patterns to develop naturally. Each session creates space for both guided practice and personal exploration.

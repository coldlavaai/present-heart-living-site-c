  { question: 'How long are postures held in Yin Yoga?', answer: 'Postures are typically held for three to five minutes, sometimes longer. This allows gentle stress to be applied to connective tissues, supporting joint mobility and flexibility over time.' },
  { question: 'Is Yin Yoga suitable for beginners?', answer: 'Yes. The slower pace makes Yin Yoga very accessible for beginners. Props are used to support comfortable positioning, and all postures can be modified to suit your body.' },
  { question: 'What is the difference between Yin Yoga and Restorative Yoga?', answer: 'Yin Yoga applies gentle stress to connective tissues for mobility and flexibility, while Restorative Yoga focuses on complete passive relaxation using full prop support. Both are slow practices but serve different purposes.' },
  { question: 'Can Yin Yoga help with stiffness?', answer: 'Regular practice can significantly improve flexibility and reduce stiffness by gently working with the fascia, ligaments and joints. Many students notice improvements within a few weeks of regular practice.' },

              Yin Yoga offers a slower and more reflective approach to yoga practice. Instead of flowing between movements, postures are held for several minutes, allowing gentle stress to be applied to connective tissues such as fascia, ligaments and joints. Here in the Scottish Highlands, the natural stillness of the landscape mirrors the quiet introspection of Yin practice.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This slower pace allows the body to gradually release tension while encouraging stillness and awareness. Students are invited to remain present with sensations that arise within the body while observing their breath and mental responses — a practice of mindfulness through the body.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A typical class at Present Heart Living near Inverness includes a series of seated or reclining postures held for extended periods, typically three to five minutes each. Between postures, students are encouraged to rest and observe how their bodies feel, noticing the subtle release and opening that occurs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The practice complements more active forms of yoga by creating space for quiet observation and relaxation. While dynamic styles like <Link href="/classes/seasonal-flow-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Seasonal Flow Yoga</Link> work with muscle strength and movement, Yin Yoga focuses on deeper structural tissues that support mobility and joint health.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              Props such as bolsters, blocks and blankets are used throughout to ensure comfort, making the practice accessible to all bodies and experience levels. <Link href="/about/audrey-buchanan" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Audrey</Link> guides each session with gentle verbal cues, creating a meditative atmosphere of calm and presence.

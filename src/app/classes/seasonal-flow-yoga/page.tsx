              Seasonal Flow Yoga is a dynamic practice that combines breath and movement through a sequence of flowing postures. Inspired by both Hatha and Vinyasa traditions, the class encourages students to move with rhythm and awareness while developing strength and flexibility in the beautiful setting of the Scottish Highlands.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The practice often reflects the natural rhythm of the seasons — something deeply felt here in the Highlands near Inverness. Movements may feel more energising and expansive during lighter months, while practices during quieter seasons may emphasise grounding and stability. This approach encourages students to practise in harmony with natural cycles, helping them remain attentive to how their bodies and energy change throughout the year.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Classes typically begin with gentle movements that prepare the body for deeper practice. Flowing sequences then develop mobility, balance and coordination while linking movement with breath. The practice gradually builds warmth in the body while encouraging concentration and awareness.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Each session closes with a relaxation period, allowing the body and mind to integrate the effects of the practice. This balance of effort and rest is central to the Seasonal Flow approach.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Seasonal Flow Yoga is suitable for both <Link href="/locations/beginner-yoga-classes" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">beginners</Link> and experienced practitioners who enjoy a more dynamic style of yoga. Movements can be modified to suit individual needs, allowing students to explore the practice at their own pace.

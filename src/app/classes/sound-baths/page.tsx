              During a session at Present Heart Living near Inverness, instruments such as singing bowls, chimes and other resonant tools are played to create gentle layers of sound. Participants usually lie comfortably while the sound fills the space, allowing the mind and body to settle into profound stillness.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The vibrations produced by singing bowls and other instruments can help shift attention away from busy thoughts and into a more relaxed state of awareness. Many people describe the experience as deeply calming and restorative — a unique form of healing that works on levels beyond words.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Sound baths are often combined with relaxation practices or meditation, creating an environment where the nervous system can slow down and release tension. Sessions may also include brief periods of guided <Link href="/classes/breathwork" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">breathwork</Link> to help participants settle into receptivity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              The sessions are suitable for anyone seeking a quiet and supportive space to relax. No previous experience with meditation or yoga is required. For many participants from Inverness, the Black Isle and across the Highlands, sound baths provide a rare opportunity to rest fully and step away from the constant stimulation of modern life.

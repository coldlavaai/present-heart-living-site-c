          Present Heart Living was founded by Audrey Buchanan, an experienced teacher with more than
          thirty years of personal yoga practice based in the Scottish Highlands. With a 500-hour Yoga
          Alliance qualification, breathwork certification and trauma-informed training, Audrey brings
          genuine depth to every class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her background in education — as both a primary teacher and head teacher — shapes her
          clear, supportive teaching style. Audrey encourages students to move with awareness and
          develop practices that support wellbeing beyond the mat.

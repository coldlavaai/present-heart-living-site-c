              Modern working environments can place significant demands on both physical and mental
              wellbeing. Long hours at desks, constant digital communication and the pressures of busy
              schedules can often lead to fatigue, stress and reduced focus.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Corporate wellbeing programmes offer organisations an opportunity to support their teams by
              creating space for movement, relaxation and mindful awareness. At Present Heart Living,
              sessions are designed to help employees step away from the demands of their workday and
              reconnect with their bodies through simple movement and breathing practices.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              These sessions can be particularly beneficial for teams experiencing workplace stress, those
              working in sedentary roles, or organisations seeking to foster a culture of care and wellbeing.

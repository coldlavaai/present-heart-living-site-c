                Audrey Buchanan is the founder and teacher behind Present Heart Living. With over thirty years of personal yoga practice and a deep connection to the Scottish Highlands, Audrey brings genuine warmth and expertise to every class.

            <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl md:text-3xl text-forest mb-6">A Lifelong Practice</h2>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Audrey Buchanan is the founder and teacher behind Present Heart Living. Her relationship with yoga began more than thirty years ago in the Scottish Highlands and has grown into a lifelong exploration of movement, mindfulness and wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For Audrey, yoga has never been simply about physical exercise. Instead, it has always been a practice of awareness — an opportunity to understand how the body moves, how the breath supports us and how moments of stillness can bring clarity to everyday life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This approach continues to shape the way she teaches today at her studio near Inverness. Classes are designed to help students explore movement with curiosity and patience, creating space for both physical development and inner awareness. Whether practising <Link href="/classes/seasonal-flow-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Seasonal Flow Yoga</Link>, <Link href="/classes/restorative-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Restorative Yoga</Link> or <Link href="/classes/breathwork" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Breathwork</Link>, students are guided to move with attention and care.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Before creating Present Heart Living, Audrey spent many years working in education as a primary teacher and later as a head teacher in the Scottish Highlands. This experience has had a strong influence on her teaching style.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Audrey brings clarity, structure and patience into every class, helping students feel comfortable and supported as they learn. Her background in education also shapes the way she explains movement and breathing practices, ensuring that students can understand not only what they are doing but why those practices support their wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This unique combination of educational expertise and deep personal yoga practice makes Audrey&apos;s classes particularly accessible for <Link href="/locations/beginner-yoga-classes" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">beginners</Link> while remaining rich and rewarding for experienced practitioners.

            <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl md:text-3xl text-forest mt-12 mb-6">A Supportive Approach to Practice</h2>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Audrey&apos;s teaching focuses on helping students develop awareness through movement and breath. Rather than encouraging performance or pushing the body beyond its limits, classes invite students to move in ways that feel supportive and sustainable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This approach allows individuals of all experience levels to explore yoga and mindful movement with confidence. Many students find that over time this style of practice supports not only greater physical strength and flexibility but also a deeper sense of calm and balance in everyday life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              Students travel from across the Highlands to practise with Audrey — from Inverness and the Black Isle to Dingwall, Beauly, Conon Bridge and beyond. Her warm and inclusive style creates a welcoming space for everyone.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Present Heart Living was created as a space where yoga and mindful movement can be explored in a supportive and accessible way, surrounded by the natural beauty of the Scottish Highlands. Based near Inverness, our studio welcomes students from across the region — from the Black Isle to Dingwall, Beauly to Muir of Ord.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Rather than focusing on performance or complex poses, the practice emphasises awareness, presence and connection with the body. Yoga and Pilates are approached as tools that support physical wellbeing while encouraging a more balanced and mindful approach to everyday life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Scottish Highlands provide a unique setting for this kind of practice. The natural landscape — with its lochs, mountains and vast open spaces — naturally encourages the sense of spaciousness and calm that lies at the heart of yoga. Many of our students find that practising here, close to nature, deepens their connection to the work.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              We offer a full range of classes including <Link href="/classes/seasonal-flow-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Seasonal Flow Yoga</Link>, <Link href="/classes/restorative-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Restorative Yoga</Link>, <Link href="/classes/yin-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Yin Yoga</Link>, <Link href="/classes/pilates" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Pilates</Link>, <Link href="/classes/breathwork" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Breathwork</Link> and <Link href="/classes/sound-baths" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Sound Baths</Link>.

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">

Her journey with yoga began more than thirty years ago and has developed into a lifelong exploration of movement, mindfulness and wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">

            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              At the heart of Present Heart Living is a simple belief: yoga and mindful movement help us become more aware of how we move, breathe and live. Classes encourage students to move with attention, breathe with intention and develop compassion toward themselves.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Over time, this awareness often supports greater balance, resilience and wellbeing in everyday life. Our <Link href="/about/teaching-philosophy" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">teaching philosophy</Link> is grounded in the understanding that yoga extends far beyond the mat — it is a way of living with greater presence and care.

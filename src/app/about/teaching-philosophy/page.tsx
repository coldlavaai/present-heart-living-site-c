            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              At Present Heart Living, yoga and mindful movement are approached as practices of awareness rather than performance. Set in the calm surroundings of the Scottish Highlands near Inverness, our practice is deeply influenced by the natural environment — the spaciousness of the landscape, the rhythm of the seasons and the quietness that supports reflection.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The intention of each class is to help students develop a deeper understanding of how their bodies move, how their breath supports that movement and how moments of stillness can bring balance to everyday life. Rather than focusing on achieving complex postures, the emphasis is on building a sustainable practice that supports strength, flexibility and resilience over time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Students are encouraged to move with attention, breathe with intention and approach the practice with curiosity and compassion. By developing awareness through movement and breath, individuals often discover that the benefits of yoga extend far beyond the mat.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              Over time, this approach can support greater physical wellbeing while also helping students navigate the demands of modern life with a greater sense of calm and clarity. This philosophy underpins all our classes — from <Link href="/classes/seasonal-flow-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Seasonal Flow Yoga</Link> to <Link href="/classes/restorative-yoga" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Restorative Yoga</Link>, <Link href="/classes/pilates" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Pilates</Link> to <Link href="/classes/breathwork" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">Breathwork</Link>.

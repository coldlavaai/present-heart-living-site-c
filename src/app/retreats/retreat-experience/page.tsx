              A retreat is more than simply attending a series of yoga classes. It is an opportunity to step away from everyday responsibilities and create space for reflection, rest and renewal. At Present Heart Living, retreats are designed to provide a supportive environment where participants can explore yoga and mindfulness at a slower, more spacious pace.

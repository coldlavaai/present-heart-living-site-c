              International retreats offer the opportunity to combine travel with meaningful time for rest, reflection and wellbeing. These retreats are designed to take place in inspiring locations where natural surroundings encourage a deeper sense of calm and presence.

              Participants are invited to step away from familiar routines and experience yoga and mindful practices within new environments.

              What International Retreats Include
            </h2>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The structure of international retreats is similar to our UK retreats, combining yoga sessions, breathwork practices and time for relaxation. However, these retreats also allow participants to explore new landscapes, cultures and experiences.

              A Nourishing Way to Travel
            </h2>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              International retreats offer an opportunity to deepen yoga practice while enjoying travel in a way that feels nourishing and restorative. Unlike conventional holidays, these experiences are designed to support genuine rest and reflection.
            </p>
            <p className="text-peat/70 leading-relaxed">
              Many participants find that returning from an international retreat feels quite different to returning from a typical holiday — with a renewed sense of clarity, calm and connection to their practice. Between international retreats, our <Link href="/classes" className="text-sage hover:text-forest underline">regular classes in the Highlands</Link> help maintain that sense of balance.
